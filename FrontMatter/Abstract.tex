Silicon Photonic technology has undergone a tremendous progress in the past decade. From demonstrations of integrated photonic designs consisting of several elements fabricated in academic and research institutes to complex designs consisting of hundreds of elements. This progress is attributed to the availability of mature and reliable semiconductors foundries such as AIM, IME, IMEC and Global Foundries. As in electrical CMOS design, these foundries provide PDKs that allow to integrate optical building blocks. These PDKs includes elements such as waveguides, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, ring resonators, passive splitters, photo-detectors and fiber coupling elements in order to design complex subsystems such as high-port count switches, transceivers and sensors. To utilize these design, the optical operation of these hundreds to elements needs to be 



consists of tenth to hundreds of optical elements that needs to be biased and simultaneously controlled to achieve an optimal operation. For system integration, the physical layer needs to be abstracted through a simple and closed-loop control plane.
